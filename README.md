# Ableton-Frontend
This responsive website is developed using pure HTML and CSS. It was developed as a part of the practice of bootstrap, media queries. This was the first frontend I have tried to develop with minimal knowledge on frontend concepts.

This website includes a responsive navbar from bootstrap and dynamically changing font sizes according to your screen sizes!
